\label{cha:Evaulation and Discussion}

In this chapter, the algorithms for each method used in this master's thesis will be evaluated. In addition, the parameters in the algorithms will be changed and their effects on computing time and the reliability of lane detection will be observed. The methods will be also compared with each other, with the aim of finding the most efficient and reliable method. In another section of this chapter, the average computation times for each of the algorithms as well as for the total lane detection process in each method will be also measured. At the end of this chapter, the problems which can occur during lane detection will also be defined.
