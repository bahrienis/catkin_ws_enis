As in all industries, technology in the automotive industry is continuing to develop 
day by day. For example, the number of sensors, and their corresponding features, is 
increasing exponentially. One such sensor is the color camera. To begin with, in the 
automotive industry, cameras were used only to assist drivers in parking and reversing. 
Nowadays, however, one of the main functions of color cameras is lane detection, in both 
autonomous cars and in cars equipped with a lane departure warning system. In this 
master's thesis, the lanes will be detected and then formulated mathematically.

The results of this master's thesis will be utilized and expanded upon by the students 
who will participated in the Echtzeitsysteme Projektseminar at the Technical University 
of Darmstadt. One of the aims of this seminar is to attend the Carolo-Cup organized 
annually by the Technical University of Braunschweig. Because of that, the width, the 
curvature, and the changes of the curvature of the track used in this master's thesis 
are the same as those belonging to the track used in the Carolo-Cup. In a real-life 
situation, there are of course oftentimes more factors that can hinder lane detection, 
including shadows cast by trees, buildings, and other structures; sunlight directly 
entering the lens of the camera and similarly less-than-ideal lighting conditions; 
dirt and debris on the road surface; and so on.

Therefore, the lanes of the track must be detected in a sufficiently short amount of 
time and there should be no dead time between lane detection and mathematical 
formulation. Lane detection must also be sufficiently robust, so that it should not be 
disrupted by less-than-ideal lighting conditions.

Autonomous driving is a topic currently being actively researched. Research on 
autonomous driving can be conducted in two fundamental areas: lane detection and lane 
guidance. With regard to lane detection, there are different scientific techniques that 
can be utilized, according to the literature, all with their own advantages and 
disadvantages under different conditions. For example, some techniques are suitable for 
straight lines, but not for curves. Others are suitable for curves as well but do not 
function well under certain light conditions. Others still are quite robust and 
suitable for curves, yet are computationally intensive (resulting in a video feed with 
significant gaps). In this master's thesis, my aim is to research and implement the 
most appropriate and effective method for use in the Carola-Cup.



\section*{1.3. Structure of Thesis}
\label{sec:Structure of Paper}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{1.3. Structure of Paper}

In Chapter \ref{cha:Fundamentals}, the fundamentals of lane detection are explained. All 
methods utilized in this thesis, along with their respective justifications, are also 
explained in this chapter. Some methods are also compared with regard to their 
advantages and disadvantages.


In Chapter \ref{cha:Implementation}, the steps of implementation are explained. The 
components can be divided broadly into the properties of the track, the hardware of the 
model car, and the software libraries and programs to be utilized. In this chapter, the 
program flow will also be explained in detail.

In Chapter \ref{cha:Evaulation and Discussion}, the results of used methods will be 
compared. The computing time of all phases in this thesis will be presented and discussed. 
Also, all used parameters and their effects to this thesis will be also presented and 
discussed. In this chapter, the answer of the question 'how can the computing time be reduced 
optimized.

In Chapter \ref{cha:Related Works}, the condition of the work will be described. Here the other 
possible solutions for lane detection will be announced and their advantages and disadvantages
will be compared with this master thesis.

In Chapter \ref{cha:Conclusion}, all results of this master thesis will be presented and also here, 
it will be announced the improvements and increments for this master thesis.
