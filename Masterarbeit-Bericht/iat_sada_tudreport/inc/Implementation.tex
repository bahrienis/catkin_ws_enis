\section{Test Track}\label{sec:Test Track}

As before mentioned, medium-term goal of this master thesis is attending to the Carola-Cup at Braunschweig University 
so the test truck was prepaid in the Carola-Cup properties by Nicolas Acero Sepulveda, who did his bachelor thesis also
with this model auto. For this test truck, two black PVC floor carpets were used and on these floor carpets, the lanes 
of the truck were made by using white electrical tape. The straight part of the truck was made on one of these PVC 
floor carpet and the curved part of truck was made on second PVC floor carpet. The straigt part of the truck is 
approximately 2 meters long and the curve radius of the curved part of test truck is approximately 1 meter. This curve 
is the tightest curve at Carola-Cup so with this test truck can be tested the worst case situation. In the Carola-Cup 
competition, the truck is much more bigger but for testing this master thesis, we don't need to build bigger test truck.

\subsection{Model Auto}\label{sec:Model Auto}


During the course of this master thesis, a model automobile was being used which was prepared for the Projectseminar 
Echtzeitsysteme at Technical University of Darmstadt. The chassis, steering mechanism, power train, and engine control 
were derived from the model-building of a Japanese company, Tamiya. The maximum velocity of the model automobile is 
approximately 1 m/s and the minimum steering radius is around 90 cm.

\subsection{Microcontroller and Main Board}\label{sec:Microcontroller and Main Board}


In this model auto, there is a microcontroller and a main board. The microcontroller is used for controlling steering 
and receiving the measurements from ultrasonic sensors and hall effect sensors. The 16-bit microcontroller is from 
MB96300 series from Fujitsu company.

The main board on the model car is from PD10BI-MT ThinMini-ITX series from MiTAC company. This main board communicate 
with the microcontroller over via UART interface through USB connection. On this main board, there is an Intel 
Quadcore-Processor and an Intel HD Graphics card. Furthermore, there is a 8 GB DDR3-1600 RAM and 1Gbit/s Ethernet, VGA, HDMI, USB 2.0/3.0, SATA ports and an Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 7260 Network adapter, which is connected to two external WLAN antennas. A 60 GB Kingston SSD-Harddisk is connected over an integrated PCI-Express Port. A 3200 mAh Li-Fe battery is used as power supply.

\subsection{Camera}\label{sec:Camera}


The camera is one of the main components of lane detection and accordingly, autonomous driving. For this thesis, I had 
to research the most suitable camera because all cameras have different properties.

At the beginning of the Projectseminar Echtzeitsysteme, the Logitech C270 HD Webcam was being used. The resolution of 
the camera is 1280x960 pixels and the Frame per Second (FPS) value is 30 Hertz (Hz) at a 640x480 pixel resolution. 
The field of View (FOV) is just 60 degrees. The problem with this camera is that if there is a curve, the camera 
cannot see all of the lanes, and thus is not very suitable for lane detection. When I started my master thesis, there 
was a Kinect v2 camera on the model car.  The Kinect v2 camera was developed by Microsoft and released in 2013. This 
camera has a depth sensor with a resolution of 512x424 pixels and its FOV is 70x60 degrees. The FPS value is 30 Hz at 
a 512x424 pixel resolution. This camera also has a color camera with resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and a FOV of 
84.1x53.8 degrees. The FPS value is 30 Hz at a 1920x1080 pixel resolution. This camera had two main disadvantages for 
this master thesis. The first disadvantage is the FOV value of camera. This value is better than the value of Logitech 
C270 camera but it is still not enough for curve lane detection. The second main disadvantage is the location of the 
color camera. The color camera of this camera is not in the middle of camera, but rather, on the right. This is a 
disadvantage for us because when there are curves going left as opposed to right, the camera is unable to see the 
left and even perhaps the middle lane of the truck. Thus, this is problematic for lane detection.

Due to these reasons, I had to choose a camera which has a sufficiently high FOV value. After doing research, I decided 
that the Genius Widecam F100 camera is the best choice for this master thesis because this camera has a FOV value of 
120 degrees and it can also be used with the Linux Operating System. The resolution of this camera is 1920x1080 pixels 
and the FOV value is 120 degrees. The FPS is 30 Hz at a 1920x1080 pixel resolution. With this camera, it is possible 
to detect most if not all lanes, including when there are curves.

\section{Software}\label{sec:Software}


In this chapter, the software algorithms will be focused, which are defined in this master thesis.  Through program flow charts and explaination of all steps of program flow charts, it will be tried to explain algorithms better. For finding the best solution, 5 different source codes versions(?variants/?methods) were generated. For all these source codes,the computing times were calculated and compared which solution can detect the lanes better. In next pages, there are detailed explanations of used versions(?variants/?methods). The development environment and the used softwares will be also described , which are used in master thesis.

\subsection{Development Environment and Related Softwares}
\label{sec:Development Environment and Related Softwares}

As also mentioned at subsection \ref{sec:Microcontroller and Main Board}, in this project the introduced main board was used. One of the compact and fast version of Linux 16.04 operating system, \textit{Lubuntu} was installed in this main board.

The version \textit{Kinetic} of ROS was used for implementation of this master thesis. ROS is the abbreviation of \textbf{R}obotic \textbf{O}perating \textbf{S}ystem, which is a robotics middleware (i.e. collection of software frameworks for robot software development). At ROS wiki page\cite{ROS}, ROS is defined that, ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot. It provides the services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers.

For using prepaid image processing functions, an open source computer vision and machine learning software library was used, which is called as OpenCV. According to OpenCV website\cite{OpenCV}, there are more than 2500 optimized algorithms in OpenCV library and OpenCV has more than 47 thousand people of user community.

ROS can be programmed by programming languages Python, C++ or Lisp and OpenCV can be programmed by programming languages Python or C++. In this master thesis, C++ was used.

\subsection{Preprocessing :}\label{sec:Preprocessing}

There are so different possibilities for lane detection algorithms. Of course, each of them has some advantages and disadvantages. In this master thesis, some different methods were defined and in this chapter, these methods will be explained in detail.

In all these methods, some processes are common, which is called as preprocessing phase. At the beginning,\emph{\color{blue} the frames are gotten from the camera via ROS-Topic.} ROS uses different image formats but OpenCV uses as another image format Matrix(Mat) object. This taken frame via ROS-Topic must be converted from ROS image data type to Mat object. For that converting, a ROS-Package were used, which is called as \textit{cvbridge}\cite{cv_bridge}. cvbridge converts to ROS image format to Mat Object which is the OpenCV Image Format. 

Mat is a class which has two parts. The parts are a matrix header and a pointer to the matrix containing the pixel values. The matrix header contains the informations like the size of matrix, storing method and etc. It has always fixed size but the size of matrix is variable from image to image.

There are so many methods, which can store the pixel values to the Mat object. In this case, the color space and used data type can be choosed. For gray images, it is easy to choose the color space because there are just two colors : black and white. With changing the density of colors(black and white), it is possible to create many shades of gray. There are more methods for colorful images. Colorful images have generally three or four components. These three components are used for RGB color values. The RGB colors are based on red, green and blues colors which can be detected all colors by human eyes. For transparency of a color can be used a fouth component which is calles as alpha(A).

There are also another color systems, which have some advantages\cite{OpenCV_Mat}. 

\begin{itemize}

\item RGB system is so similar to human eye use, but at OpenCV display system uses BGR system which has another row of colors than RGB system  

\item HSV and HLS systems are more natural way to describe colors. They decompose colors into their hue, saturation and value/luminance components. Another advantage of HSV and HLS make less sensitive to the light conditions of the input image.

\item At JPEG image formats is used YCrCb system.

\item if the distance of a given color to another color want to be measured is CIE L*a*b* more suitable than others.

\end{itemize}
